			// could be downgraded to plaintext and its cookie intercepted. Guarded to non-Development
			// because local development runs over plain HTTP. UseHsts adds the policy to HTTPS responses
			// only - HstsMiddleware returns without writing a header when Request.IsHttps is false - so the
			// header is published on the secured responses that FOLLOW the redirect, never on the redirect
			// itself. Ordering HSTS first is still correct, because the two calls must not be transposed:
			// UseHttpsRedirection short-circuits a plaintext request, so anything after it never runs for
			// that request at all.
			//
			// Ordering is deliberate and load-bearing: this sits AFTER UseCors. The CORS middleware
			// short-circuits cross-origin preflight, so an OPTIONS request is answered before it can reach
			// the redirect. That is what avoids the documented failure where HTTPS redirection answers a
			// preflight with a redirect the browser rejects as invalid. Moving this above UseCors would
			// reintroduce it.
			//
			// THREAT ADDRESSED - finding F-06: app.UseHsts() alone does NOT publish the mandated policy. It
			// emits whatever HstsOptions holds, and the framework defaults are thirty days with subdomains
			// excluded - "max-age=2592000". Because HstsMiddleware assigns the header by indexer and runs
			// after UseSecurityHeaders(), it overwrote the mandated value rather than agreeing with it. The
			// exact one-year, subdomain-inclusive values are now configured once in AddErp through
			// services.AddHsts(), so both writers emit the identical string. This call site must not be
			// given per-host options, and AddErp's registration must not be removed, or this line silently
